# Projects

A list of all our projects.

We use github issues for tracking projects. This is different from datproject/discussions. This repo is intended for more concrete discussion of a project that is either currently in progress or soon to be in progress. The discussions repo is a more general 'catch-all' for the related ecosystem.

## Creating a Project 

A project is a high-level description of a set of requirements defined by one (or more) modules or repositories. Each project has it's own issue, with a short title and a description. Descriptions should be sufficient enough to describe the following: 
  * who is a user of the project?
  * how would the user use the project?
  * why the project is important to the ecosystem?
  * what defines the minimum requirements to sufficiently release (version 1)
  * what are some stretch goals or interesting features for further releases (version 2, 3)

Each project should be assigned a person, or 'owner,' who is responsible for that project being released.

## Definition of Project Owner

The 'project owner' is responsible for that project being released. This person keeps the issues clean, up-to-date and relevant to the repository, merges major pull requests, and schedules releases. This role keeps the team focused on a particular goal. 

## Making Decisions

While we have 'Project Owners,' there is a sense of contribution to all the projects by all of the team members and the surrounding open source ecosystem. Any decisions made in regards to the project are fine as long as we are all considering the opinions of other folks on the team, are nice people generally, and willing to make compromises.

## Closing a Project

A project can remain open for a long time, even when minimum requirements have already been met, as long as its still being actively developed by folks on the team. If people agree that the project is ready to be closed, feel free to close it.
